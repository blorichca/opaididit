## S2 AI?

### A bootstrap component

---

Features 3 Cards forming a single Background Image:

- S2 should display 3 hardcoded feature vertical cards (each card takes a full bootstrap line as in other components fthe page)

- All 3 cards are starting with a question followed by var number of bullet point

  1. Card 1 - 1 bp
  2. Card 2 - 4 bp 
  3. Card 3 - 3 bp 

- The full component size should contain

  1. 8 * bp height
  2. 3 * question height
  3. 2 * gap between card

- Each card will show the correlated portion of the image, so all 3 together will form the image
- The gaps between the cards will be white

### Bg image

- splitting the pic will be done in js
- Path img/s2_ai_chatbot_opa_1.png
- Style 50% transparent
- If frame is too short, zoom the image

### Info Icons with Tooltips:

- Each card should contain an info icon (using Font Awesome) positioned appropriately (e.g., top-right corner of the card).
- Tooltips should be initialized with the initialize Tooltips function, which attaches to the info icons.
- When hovering over the info icon, the card will be covered in black and the description of the cards will be written in white

### Tooltip Content and Behavior:

- The content for tooltips should be gathered by mapping over bullet Points for each card, combining the text and description into HTML format.

### Visual and Interaction Details:

- The icon should remain visible when not hovered over.
- Upon hovering over the card, the icon will jump drawing attention of the user

### Technical Specifications:

- The Bootstrap framework should be utilized, specifically the grid system and carousel component.
- Font Awesome may be used for icons.

### Design and Responsiveness:

- A mobile-first design approach should be prioritized, ensuring the cards are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes.
- Consistent styling should be maintained across all elements of the page.

### Customization and Modularity:

- The page should allow for easy updates to the feature cards' content.
- The code structure should support modularity, allowing sections to be easily modified or supported through well-documented code and designated CSS classes.

### Better engineering

- Comments!
- All sections specific classes should start with the “S<SectionNumber>-” prefix

### Cards style

- all the text is centered

### Cards info

- Title -> question
- Tex > bullet point
- Description -> relevant tooltip-----
- Take content from aiChatbotsInfo but build  the cards data manually
